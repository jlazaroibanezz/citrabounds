The provided .py files can be used to reproduce the simulation results of the paper: "Enhancing the accuracy of genome-scale metabolic models with kinetic information". The attached folders 'original' and 'citramax' hold the code for the original model of E. Coli and for the citramalate-producing model respectively.

The methodology is only explained for the original model, but works similarly for the citramalate-producing model.

- Download the E. coli genome-scale metabolic model MODEL1108160000 from: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1108160000
- Donwload the files contained in the folder 'original'.
- Once imported all the libraries required in the script, run in your terminal the following command:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
